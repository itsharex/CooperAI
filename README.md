# CooperAi

Therapy being the much needed thing in our society, still isn't reaching everyone that needs it. Common reasons being:
- Lack of mental health services in ones locality.
- Preference of wanting to seek a more anonymous exchange rather than an in-person meet.
- Feeling that one's problems are trivial and not worth seeking therapy for.
- Traditional therapy can be costly therefore it's not sustainable to seek it customarily.

THIS application is intended to fill the gap left by tradition therapy. However, it is imperative to note that **any Virtual AI Therapist should not replace human therapists entirely**. It only serves to complement the traditional therapy. It cannot replicate the same level of human connection, empathy, and intuition that a human therapist can provide (at least not as of now).

> Note: The demo version is no longer available because my openAI free-tier has expiredðŸ¥². Right now, the app can only be used via cloning the repo and providing your own api-key in the .env file. To build the app, run: `npm run tauri build`

P.S- This application was created as part of a college project. The original intent was to create my own AI but due to time constraints; I had to resort to using the obvious option: gpt-3 api. Hopefully, in future, I integrate my own AI. I enjoyed creating the frontend with Nuxt and I nearly killed myself while writing the backend in Rust as I had no prior experience. After enduring it however, I do have a lot of admiration for Rust.
