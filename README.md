Therapy, being the much needed thing in our society, still isn't effectively reaching everyone that needs it.

**Common reasons being:**

- Feeling that one's problems are trivial and not worth seeking therapy for.
- Preference of wanting to seek a more anonymous exchange rather than an in-person meet.
- Traditional therapy can be costly therefore it's not sustainable to seek it customarily.
- Lack of availability in one's locality.

So, the purpose of this project was to try and bridge the gap left by traditional therapy.

> [!NOTE]
> No AI should replace human entirely (except for journalist). Cooper only serves to complement the traditional therapy. <br>
> It cannot replicate the same level of human connection, empathy, and intuition that a human therapist can provide (at least not as of now ðŸ‘€).

## Scope

This was 2nd year college summer project, in which I just add a function to provide API Keys (at the cost of user's $$$) so they could chat with Gippity models, but on this particular app for some reason. For a real-world usecase, it's totally useless (which I intented to change for some time but then I got busy). The only good thing about this is that it's built using Nuxt and Tauri; so it could potentially help anyone that's struggling to patch both of them up; by being a reference point. 

Maybe someday I'll come back and make it meaningful. I do have plans though.
