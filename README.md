# CooperAi

Therapy is a way most people can take their emotional load-off and reflect on life more profoundly. Not everyone has access to traditional therapy as there can be various barriers such as -- sparsity of mental health services in their locality or transportation issues. Others may wanna seek a more anyonymous exchange rather than an in-person meet. Traditional therapy can be costly therefore not everyone can afford it customarily.

A Virtual AI Therapist is intended to fill the gap left by tradition therapy. However, it is imperative to note that **Virtual AI Therapist should not replace human therapists entirely**. It only serves to complement the traditional therapy. It cannot replicate the same level of human connection, empathy, and intuition that a human therapist can provide (at least not as of now).

P.S- This application was created as part of a college project. The original intent was to create my own AI but due to time constraints; I had to resort to using the obvious gpt-3 api. Hopefully, in future, I integrate my own AI; however the application has a very clean UI with a very unique touch to it. I enjoyed creating the frontend with Nuxt and I nearly killed myself while writing the backend in Rust (just realized they rhyme) as I had no prior experience of Rust programming language. After enduring it however, I do have a lot of admiration for Rust.
