## About 📖
This project is a basic implementation of a _AI therapy_ application. It calls upon GPT-3.5 turbo via API to provide the AI integration. The backend is written in Rust, and the frontend is made with Vue.

### Significance 🏆
Therapy, being the much needed thing in our society, still isn't reaching everyone that needs it. Common reasons being:
- Feeling that one's problems are trivial and not worth seeking therapy for.
- Preference of wanting to seek a more anonymous exchange rather than an in-person meet.
- Traditional therapy can be costly therefore it's not sustainable to seek it customarily.
- Lack of availability in one's locality.

So, to bridge the gap left by traditional therapy, this project was created.

> [!NOTE]
>  Any Virtual AI Therapist should not replace human therapists entirely. It only serves to complement the traditional therapy. It cannot replicate the same level of human connection, empathy, and intuition that a human therapist can provide (at least not as of now).
