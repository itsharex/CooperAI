# CooperAi

Therapy is a way most people can take their emotional load-off and reflect on life more profoundly. Many individuals may not have access to traditional therapy due to various barriers, such as lack of mental health services in their area or transportation issues.  Some people may feel more comfortable seeking support from an AI therapist instead of face-to-face therapy.  Traditional therapy can be expensive, and not everyone can afford regular it.
A Virtual AI Therapist seeks to eliminate these challenges. However it is important to note that **Virtual AI Therapist should not replace human therapists entirely**. They can complement traditional therapy but may not be able to replicate the same level of human connection, empathy, and intuition that a human therapist can provide.

P.S- This application was created as part of a college project. The original intent was to create my own AI but due to time constraints; I had to resort to using the obvious gpt-3 api. Hopefully, in future, I integrate my own AI; however the application has a very clean UI with a very unique touch to it. I enjoyed creating the frontend with Nuxt and I nearly killed myself while writing the backend in Rust (just realized they rhyme) as I had no prior experience of Rust programming language. After enduring it however, I do have a lot of admiration for Rust.
